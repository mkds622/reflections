When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
I would use a remote repository in all these cases:
1.When I want to make a project public.
2.When I want others to help me with developing the project.
3.When I want a copy of the best working form of my project on a repository so that any changes in my local repository dont affect the working of my project that is on the remote repository. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
